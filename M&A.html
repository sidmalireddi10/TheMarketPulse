            Western Midstream Partners (NYSE: WES) has agreed to acquire Aris Water Solutions in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $1.5 billion. The acquisition expands Western's footprint in the Permian Basin and diversifies its operations in the growing water management sector.
            <br></br>
            Aris complements Western's existing produced-water business and enhances its ability to compete for new development opportunities.

            The acquisition is expected to be accretive to 2026 free cash flow per unit, representing a 7.5x multiple on consensus 2026 EBITDA including $40 million in targeted cost synergies. Aris shareholders are expected to own approximately 7% of Western's outstanding common stock post-transaction.
