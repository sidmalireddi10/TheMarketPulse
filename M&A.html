									<p>The world of mergers and acquisitions never slows down, and the past few days have brought us two interesting deals worth watching. First up, we've got TerraVest Industries making a strategic play in the tank trailer space, followed by TowneBank's move to expand its banking reach. These transactions highlight how companies are actively positioning themselves for growth—whether by entering new markets or doubling down on existing strengths. Let's dive into the details.</br>
									
									<h3>1.TerraVest Industries Acquires L.B.T. For $16 Million</h3>
									
									
								
									On Friday, April 4<sup>th</sup>, TerraVest Industries announced their acquisition of L.B.T., a North American manufacturer of tank trailers. LBT was acquired for an EV of approximately $16 million. LBT has built a strong reputation for their high-quality and innovative trailers, and fits perfectly into TerraVest’s family with their desire to grow in the tank trailer business. With the resources TerraVest already has, it positions them well in the tanker market and allows them to deliver greater value to their customers and drive growth.

									<strong>Acquirer:</strong> TerraVest Industries (Vegreville, Canada)
									<br><strong>Target: </strong>L.B.T. Inc. (Omaha, Nebraska)

									<br><br><h3>2. TowneBank Seeks To Acquire Old Point Financial</h3>
									Townebank has agreed to acquire Old Point Financial, parent of Old Point National Bank of Phoebus, in a deal valued at approximately $203 million. Old Point shareholders can either take $41 cash, or 1.14 shares of TowneBank common stock for each share they held. While the acquisition is still not final due to regulatory and shareholder approvals still necessary, it is expected to go through officially during the second half of the year. TowneBank will definitely benefit from the acquisition, and even predicts it to lead to a boost in their EPS by approximately 10%.
