								<p>Between April 1 and April 7, 2025, several significant business developments occurred:</br>

									<h3>Global Stock Markets Plunge Amid New U.S. Tariffs</h2>
									
									On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump announced many tariffs. This includes a 10% baseline tariff on all imports and higher rates for specific countries, such as 54% for China and 20% for the European Union.
									This was an aggressive move, known as "Liberation Day." It was aimed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, but now there are fears of a possible global trade war. The market reacted very negatively to this announcement.
									The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 1,679 points (3.98%) on April 3 and an additional 2,231 points (5.5%) on April 4. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also experienced significant declines, entering bear market territory.
									Investors have expressed concerns about the tariffs potentially disrupting international trade and slowing global economic growth.
									<br><br>
									Despite this downturn in stock markets following the tariff announcements, President Trump said that he had confidence in a swift economic recovery. He said that the markets would "boom" and encouraged U.S. companies
									to focus on domestic manufacturing to mitigate impact of the tariffs. The President aimed to reassure investors and the public, even though many economists are still skeptical about the potential of a quick rebound
									with the problems that may stem from international trade relations.
									
									</br></br><h3>China Retaliates with Tariffs on U.S. Goods</h3>
									
									In response to the U.S. tariffs, China announced on April 4 that it would impose a 34% tariff on American imports, effective on April 10. This announcement has displayed escalated tensions between the world's
									two largest economies. It also has sparked fear of a prolonged trade conflict and war. It has additionally contributed to further declines in global stock markets, with analysts warning that there may be significant
									disruptions in global supply chains and increased cost for consumers.
									
									</br></br><h3>Oil Prices Decline Amid Trade War Concerns</h3>
									
									The escalated trade tensions between the U.S. and Chine has led to a signficant drop in oil prices. On April 4, crude oil prices fell to their lowest levels since 2021. Two of the top grades in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude
									have dropped $60 per barrel and $63.15 per barrel (3.7%) respectively. The decline was driven by fears that there could be a potential recession spurring from the trade war, ultimately reducing the global demand for oil.
									Energy companies have also faced increased volatility as investors have looked into the potential impact this could have on future earnings.
									
									</br></br><h3>Effects of Tariffs</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Jefferies Advises Tech Giants to Adjust Performance Goals</strong> <br>Financial services firm Jefferies advised major technology companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, to revise their performance targets
										downwards due to the economic uncertainties that the new tariffs introduced. This reflects concerns that the trade tensions could decrease consumer spending and lead to disruptions in global supply chains, ultimately impacting the tech
										sector's profitability and growth.</li><br>
										<li><strong>London IPO Market Faces Uncertainty Due to Tariffs</strong><br>The introduction of U.S. tariffs has cast a shadow on London's initial public offering (IPO) market. Companies such as Shawbrook Bank and Shein postponed their IPO
										plans. This is due to the increased market volatility and investor caution from the trade disputes. Market analysts noted that uncertainty regarding international trade policies could slowdown capital-raising activities
										and affect the valuations of companies planning to go public.</li><br>
										<li><strong>Delta Air Lines Lowers Earnings Guidance Amid Recession Fears</strong><br>Delta Air Lines adjusted its first-quarter earnings guidance downward, because of the weakening consumer and corporate confidence linked to the ongoing trade tensions.
										The airline now is only anticipating revenue growth of 3%-4% and earnings between 30-50 cents per share. These values are significantly below earlier projections. The revisions reflect concerns that increased travel costs because of tariffs and a potential
										economic slowdown could reduce demand for air travel.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Levi Strauss & Co. Reports Strong First-Quarter Financial Results</h3>
									Levi Strauss & Co. announced better-than-expected financial results for the first quarter of 2025. The company reported net revenues up by 3% and organic net revenues increasing by 9%. Adjusted earnings per share rose by 52% year over year. This 
									reflects the strong operational perfromance despite broader market challenges. These positive results have stemmed from the successful product launches and effective cost management strategies.

									</br></br><h3>April Kicks Off Major Sports Business Moves</h3>
									
									In the United Kingdom, Premier League clubs like Manchester City and Arsenal have secured multi-year endorsement deals. City has extended its partnership with Puma for a record breaking £85 million-per-year and Arsenal booked a sleeve sponsorship deal
									with fintech firm Wise worth £30 million annually. In the U.S., MLB opened its season with a boost in streaming presence. This is with Amazon Prime securing Thursday night broadcasting rights, coming alongside their Thursday Night Football rights. ESPN 
									has also finalized a $32 billion extension with the NBA for broadcasting rights through 2036, along with streaming through ESPN+ and Disney+. Venture capital activity has also been seen with Andreessen Horowitz and Courtside Ventures co-leading a $95 million
									investment into Whoop, the wearable tech company that focuses on athlete biometric tracking. Top-tier leagues and companies are capitalizing on fan engagement, digital platforms, and performance innovation, shaping the future of sports business.
