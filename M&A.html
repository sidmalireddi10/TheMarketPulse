									<p>The world of mergers and acquisitions shows no signs of slowing, with two major deals announced this week that could reshape their respective industries. From bold moves in luxury fashion to strategic plays in financial infrastructure, companies are continuing to reposition themselves for growth, resilience, and long-term value creation. Let’s take a closer look at what’s unfolding.</br>
									
									<h3>1.Prada Purchasing Versace From Capri Holdings</h3>
									
									
								
									Prada has agreed to buy Versace from Capri Holdings, the U.S. luxury group and one of the biggest names in Italian fashion, at 1.25 billion euros ($1.4 billion). The main reason Prada was open to buying Versace was because it offered untapped growth potential. However, It is planned to be funded by 1.5 billion euros in new debt, and has already been approved by the Prada and Capri Holdings board of directors. Prada emphasizes the points that they hope to build sustainable revenue growth, and ensures that Versace will maintain its DNA and authenticity, while also benefiting from its expertise and capabilities. While Capri Holdings also owns fashion leaders such as Michael Kors or Jimmy Choo, Versace represented 20% of its 2024 revenue, which totaled 5.2 billion euros. However, it had been struggling to hold its bold profile in this era where quiet luxury has become the highlight. Donatella Versace, the chief brand ambassador of Versace, stated, “I am absolutely delighted to become part of the Prada family,” and indicates a strong partnership between these Italian leaders.

									Amid a wave of strategic acquisitions spanning various industries, the financial sector has seen another significant deal surface...
									
									<br><br><h3>2. S&P Global and CME Group Selling OSTTRA to KKR</h3>
									S&P Global and CME Group signed an agreement to sell OSTTRA to KKR’s investment funds for $3.1 billion. OSTTRA is a joint venture formed by S&P and CME in 2021, which provides post-trade solutions including confirmations, transferring cash & securities, managing compliance, and more. Additionally, it helps banks, asset managers, and also brokers across markets like foreign exchange (FX), credit, and equities. Because it was a 50/50 joint venture, the total EV of $3.1 billion will be divided evenly between S&P and CME. Following the deal’s close, KKR will have full ownership. KKR has been motivated for this takeover due to their North American PE strategy, of making investments in businesses that are less cyclical and more resilient to market disruptions, and to further its investment in the technology developments. KKR also plans to implement an equity ownership program for OSTTRA’s 1,500 employees.
