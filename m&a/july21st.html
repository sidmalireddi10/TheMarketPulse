            <p>This week saw major moves in entertainment and healthcare technology as Paramount merges with Skydance to reshape streaming while Waystar acquires Iodine Software to boost its AI healthcare platform.

            </br>
            
            <h3>1. Paramount and Skydance Media Merge in $8 Billion Deal</h3>
            
            Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) has received regulatory approval to proceed with its $8 billion merger with Skydance Media. The FCC cleared the deal in a 2-1 vote, allowing the combined company to close by September. Skydance founder David Ellison will be CEO of the new entity as they plan to enhance Paramount's streaming offerings for the changing entertainment landscape.
            <br></br>
            The deal faced challenges after CBS became involved in a dispute with former President Trump, resulting in a $16 million settlement. The FCC's approval came after Skydance committed to implementing oversight for CBS News content. This merger offers Paramount a strategic reset through enhanced direct-to-consumer offerings and a stronger focus on digital streaming.
            <br></br>
            The combined company will leverage Skydance's production capabilities with Paramount's extensive content library and distribution networks. Investors are watching closely to see how the new leadership will navigate the competitive streaming market against giants like Netflix and Disney+.
